  <li style= "color:yellow" >A ratio is formed when two quantities are compayellow by division that is, a/b or a:b.</li style= "color:yellow" >
  <li style= "color:yellow" >A ratio is written in its simplest form and has no unit.</li style= "color:yellow" >
  <li style= "color:yellow" >If a quantity, increases (or decreases) in the ratio a:b, then the new quantity is b/a of the original quantity, b/a is called the multiplying factor.</li style= "color:yellow" >
  <li style= "color:yellow" >If we have to divide a given number A in the ratio a:b:c ,then,
<br> First part = a / a+b+c    x   A 
<br>Second part =  b/a+b+c       x   A
<br>  Third part = c/a+b+c     x  A </li style= "color:yellow" >
	<li style= "color:yellow" >Two equal ratios are called a proportion.The first and fourth terms are called extremes and second and third terms are called means.</li style= "color:yellow" >
	<li style= "color:yellow" >Four quantities a,b,c and d are said to be in proportion if a/b =c/d.</li style= "color:yellow" >
	<li style= "color:yellow" >In a proportion a:b :: c:d,d is said to be fourth proportion.In a proportion a:b :: c:d,d is said to be fourth proportion.</li style= "color:yellow" >
	<li style= "color:yellow" >Three quantities a,b,c are said to be in continued proportion if b2=ac</li style= "color:yellow" >
	<li style= "color:yellow" >In the continued proportion a:b :: b:c,b is called the mean proportional between a and c,and c is called the third proportional.</li style= "color:yellow" >
